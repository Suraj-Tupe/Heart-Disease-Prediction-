# Heart-Disease-Prediction-
The prediction of heart disease is considered one of the most important topics in health domain. With the machine learning algorithms and having large amounts of data, it is possible to extrapolate information that can help doctors make more accurate predictions.  Prediction of CHD is a much complex challenge considering the level of expertise and knowledge required for accurate result. According to a survey by WHO, medical professionals can correctly predict heart disease with only 67% accuracy.  In this project , a number of independent variables such as sex, age, cigsPerDay, totChol, sysBP and glucose will be used along with a dependent variable (TenYearCHD class) during the training phase to build a classification model. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) or not.
